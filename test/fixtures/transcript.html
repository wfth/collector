    <h1>Struggling to Kneel</h1>
    <h2>The Affections of a Godly Man &#x2013; Part II</h2>
    <h2>Romans 1:9-10</h2>
    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>I have been preaching a series of sermons to men.  The response from many men has been encouraging and moving.</p>
    <p>One man jokingly said to me, &#x201C;You know, I&#x2019;ve noticed, over the years, that you&#x2019;re a lot harder on men that you are on women.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>He is probably right.  I do believe that the fundamental responsibility for leading the church, the home, the marriage, and the family is the shepherd, and every man is, in some way, a shepherd.  However, I do not like the idea that I am harder on men than women.</p>
    <p>One man sent some rather funny things about women and marriage to me.  At first I thought they would be too blunt to repeat, but after that comment, I thought I would take a chance and balance the scales between the men and the women a little by reading a few of them.</p>
    <p>One fellow said, &#x201C;I married Miss Right.  I just didn&#x2019;t know her first name was Always.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>&#x201C;The last argument I had with my wife was all my fault,&#x201D; one man said to another.</p>
    <p>&#x201C;Oh, why was that?&#x201D;</p>
    <p>&#x201C;Well, she asked me what was on the TV, and I said, &#x2018;Dust.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
    <p>I think that is enough, don&#x2019;t you?</p>
    <p>I have specifically begun addressing the men in this series of messages entitled, &#x201C;The Affections of a Godly Man&#x201D;.  The truths, however, from Romans, chapter 1, certainly apply to every believer.  They are, I believe, truths that every woman can pray her husband becomes; truths that every daughter can look for in a future husband; truths that every son can grow up to be like.</p>
    <p>When Paul wrote to the Christians living in Rome, Italy, beginning in chapter 1, and verse 8, we are given, among many wonderful truths, a personal look at the apostle Paul.  This is the man who shocks us with his candor, as he writes in his first letter to the Corinthians, in chapter 4, verse 16,</p>
    <p>Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.</p>
    <p>He could say that, not because he was perfect, but because he was progressing in his walk and was a little further down the path than the others.</p>
    <p>In the verses that we are about to look at, in Romans, chapter 1, we will discover, as Barnhouse observed, what made the apostle Paul &#x201C;tick&#x201D;.  What did he think about?  What did he long for?  What did he feel passionate about doing?  What drove his affections in life?</p>
    <p>We will also discover a model for every man.  This model is from a man who was not behind a pulpit, nor behind a university lectern, nor in front of a public audience making some carefully developed speech, but was a man on his knees.</p>
    <p>E. M. Bounds was born in 1835.  At one time, this lawyer served as a chaplain in the Civil War.  Afterwards, he served as a pastor.  He spent the last eighteen years of his life in prayer and writing.  His writings would be ignored until long after his death, yet his words are as needed today as at any other time in modern history.  He wrote the following potent words,</p>
